Project Description:
This project is a technical recreation of the front page of The Sadaqat Cawnpore newspaper from 1948. The objective was to transform a complex handwritten Urdu layout into a modern, semantic HTML5 structure while preserving the historical broadsheet aesthetic and rephrasing the content into professional English.

Features Implemented:

Columnar Layout: Utilized a 2-column structure (64% / 36% split) to accurately replicate the newspaper's original broadsheet spacing.

Semantic HTML5: Implemented a full suite of semantic tags for better document accessibility.

Complex Inline CSS: Simulated vintage borders, double-lined separators, and aged paper textures using advanced inline style attributes only.

Content Translation: Fully translated and expanded 1940s-era historical news reports regarding the Cairo assassination and the Palestine crisis.

Lists and Hierarchy: Used unordered lists for subscription pricing and a strict heading hierarchy for logical content flow.

Challenges Faced:
The primary challenge was managing the vertical alignment of the right-hand sidebar sections (Pricing and Literature) using only table-based layout logic without external CSS. This was solved by grouping auxiliary content within a semantic tag and carefully balancing padding to ensure the layout remains visually stable across various browser widths.
