Project Description
This project is a technical recreation of the front page of "The Sadaqat Cawnpore" newspaper from 1948. The objective was to transform a complex handwritten Urdu layout into a modern, semantic HTML5 structure while preserving the historical broadsheet aesthetic and rephrasing the content into professional English.

Features Implemented
Columnar Layout: Utilized a 2-column <table> structure (64%/36% split) to accurately replicate the newspaper's original broadsheet spacing.
Semantic HTML5: Implemented the full suite of semantic tags including <header>, <nav>, <article>, <section>, <aside>, and <footer> for better document accessibility.
Complex Inline CSS: Simulated vintage borders, double-lined separators, and aged paper textures using advanced inline style attributes only.
Content Translation: Fully translated and expanded 1940s-era historical news reports regarding the Cairo assassination and the Palestine crisis.
Lists and Hierarchy: Used an unordered list (<ul>) for subscription pricing and a strict heading hierarchy (<h1> through <h5>) for logical content flow.

Challenges Faced
The primary challenge was managing the vertical alignment of the right-hand sidebar sections (Pricing and Literature) using only table-based layout logic without the aid of external CSS. I solved this by grouping auxiliary content within a semantic <aside> tag and carefully balancing padding to ensure the layout remains visually stable across various browser widths.
